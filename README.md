# Fast-Food-Data-Analysis
This project explores fast food consumption trends using data analysis and visualization techniques. The dataset includes various nutritional values, menu items, and calorie information from multiple fast food chains.

Key Features

✔️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.

✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying patterns, trends, and insights.

✔️ Data Visualization – Using matplotlib and seaborn to create meaningful graphs.

✔️ Statistical Insights – Understanding calorie distribution, nutritional facts, and potential health impacts.

✔️ Machine Learning (if applicable) – Predicting calorie content based on food characteristics.

Tech Stack

🔹 Python

🔹 Pandas – Data manipulation

🔹 Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

🔹 NumPy – Numerical operations

🔹 Scikit-learn (if used) – Machine learning

Installation & Usage
